# Text Processing (The Library)

The goal of this library is to provide a set of common functions for preprocessing text.  Examples include:

* spell checking
* white space normalization
* casing
* sub-sequence matching
* deduplication
* stemming
* lemmatization
* fuzzy string matching
* And more (to come)
